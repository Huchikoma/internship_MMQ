        <projectName>Development and Measurement Analysis of Design Data for Laser Powder Bed Additive Manufacturing of Nickel Alloy 625</projectName>
        <projectDescription>The purpose of the project reported herein was develop, with industry input, a method for data generation and reporting for a specific metal AM process 
            known as laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). The method, known as the Manufacturing Plan, was demonstrated specifically for nickel alloy 625 produced using Delta MU200 Direct 
            Metal Laser Sintering machines.The Manufacturing Plan is broken into two main sections, one to define the production process and one to record it. The Manufacturing Plan 
            was demonstrated with two controlled variables: machine serial number and build environment. All other conditions were the same including build geometry, powder lot, 
            process parameter sets and heat treatment. To this end, four total L-PBF builds were produced on three different serial number machines and in argon or nitrogen environments. 
            The build coupons received a stress relief at 1038°C, followed by a hot isostatic pressure thermal treatment at 1121°C.</projectDescription>
